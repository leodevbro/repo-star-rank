This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I have used TypeScript and SASS (SCSS).

## How To Run:

In the project directory, first run:

### `yarn`

So, all the necessary dependencies will be installed.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
